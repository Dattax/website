## Development Instructions
- All the source files are located in `src/` folder, any update to the website should be done from
  this folder, otherwise it will be overwritten by the next `gulp` task
- To install the dependencies do: `$ npm install`
- After any change you do to any `HTML`, `SCSS`, or `JS` file in the `src/` folder, you can run `$
  gulp` to test the changes.
- Any new images will be added to `src/img`. After an image has been added, run `$ gulp imagesTask`
- Do not push any of the files generated by `gulp` or `gulp imagesTask` to the GitHub repo. They are
  generated by a CI's pipeline when the changes are merged to the repository branch.
